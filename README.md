## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- HTML custom data attributes
- [CSS Open Props](https://open-props.style/) - Supercharged CSS variables
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Superfast bundling tool

### What I learned

I learned to use CSS Open Props in this project.

For example, using the `--font-weight` property to style the page header:
```css
.header__title {
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-6);
}
.header__title span:first-of-type {
  font-weight: var(--font-weight-2);
}
```

### Continued development

I would also like to have a two-column layout for mid-size screens.
